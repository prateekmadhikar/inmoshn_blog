<h4>TL;DR: The motor mount is done and ready for use.</h4>

<h3>Longboard Motor Mount</h3>
<p>The motor mount is what we use to place the motor onto the truck at a fixed distance from the wheels.</p>

<p>In the image above, the motor mount is the piece that connects is connected both to the motor and to the truck of the longboard. The piece right behind the motor mount is the anti-rotation arm. The anti rotation arm was initially designed and placed there because the truck in our CAD had a circular cross section. With a circular cross section, the motor mount has the ability, although hard to do so, to rotate about the truck. To avoid that from happening, the anti-rotation arm was placed.</p>

<p>The above being our inital design, we decided to simplify that design taking into account that the longboard we had bought had a not-circular cross section.</p>

<p>With the simplified design, we reduced the number of parts we had to make and reduced the complexity of the single part we had to make to speed up our process of getting to our first working prototype.</p>

<p>For each design iteration, we printed out the part to scale and placed it on to the truck to test size and positioning. By doing so, we avoided ending up with any regrets about our dimensions/positioning. Checcck it below!</p>

<p>After 3 iterations, we finally got to a point where the motor mount looked like we wanted it to and it fit well on to the truck. With the final design iteration in hand, we machine a piece of aluminum into the motor mount.</p>

<p>In the image above, the machine motor mount is used to place the motor on to the truck. Note that we have also decided to place the motor outside of the board instead of under the board (which is what the images earlier in the post suggest) because we think it will allow us to move the motor away from harm and it will help us with the placement of the rest of the components that are yet to be shown.</p>

<p>With the motor mount machined and ready for use, all our mechanical work is completed (for now before we need to iterate) and we're ready for the wheels on the longboard to go round and round!</p>

<p>Tune in next post when we have a spinning motor right round, baby; right round like a record, baby; right round round round.</p>

<p>That's all for this week! I'll leave you with my favourite video/gif/picture of the week at the end of each blog post as a thank you for reading the blogposts üòÑ</p>

<p>Robots ü§ñ are taking over the world and "I'm not a robot captcha" is the first victim ‚ò†Ô∏è. Is this the first case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a> being passed by AI??</p>
