<h4>TL;DR: Electrical system complete with addition of mechanical relay and low-amp switch.</h4>

<h3>Power Switch for Entire Board System</h3>
<p>A key problem with the turn-on of our speed controller was solved. Since there was no power switch for the system, connecting the battery to the speed controller resulted in a massive initial spark, due to the high current draw in charging large capacitors. While a switch would be the simplest solution, it was not the most appropriate solution as high-rated ampere switches (60+ amps) are quite expensive and defeat the purpose of our affordable, multi-board solution. A cheap alternative solution was found which involved using a low-amp switch and a mechanical relay.</p>
